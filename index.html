     <h1>Contrasting Societies Thought Experiment<br>____________________________________</h1>
    
	<!--Section I-->
	
	
	<h2>I. The Habitat.</h2>
	<p>A. Setup.</p>
	<h4>1. The Habitat, also known as the Hab, is a 20 km in diameter circular environment constructed of ultra strong materials resistant to any and all stresses. It has a glass dome reaching 4 km at its peak in the center. </h4>
	<h4>2. Three sections equally share area of the Habitat, each sectioned off by a 200 foot wall. Each section, known as a district houses one of three different social groups; Teleios, Imperium, and Proelium.</h4>
	<h4>3. At the centerpoint of the Hab is a second domed building, known as the Center, as detailed in this <a href="https://www.google.com/imghp?hl=en&tab=wi&ogbl">diagram (img.2)</a>. It houses the System and is the epicenter for all control in the entire Hab.</h4>
	
<!--Section II-->
	
	<h2>II. The System.</h2>
	<p>A. Admin humans (The Guides).</p>
	<h4>1. The admininstrative humans who control the System are known as the Guides, and dictate to the machines how to run the Habitat. They have total and complete control over all systems in the Hab, and design the general AIs that keep the Hab running. They have no feelings toward the Citizens who exist in the Hab under their care; they only have a sense of duty to keep as many of them alive and maintain the concept laid out by the Founder Guides. They only wish to maintain the status quo of the Hab, and do not have greed or become power hungry.</h4>
	<h4>2. They have direct authority over the machines, to keep them in line so they do not make mistakes or make unauthorized changes that could be devastating. No incidents have happened in decades due to the tight knit system of accident prevention.</h4>
	
	<p>B. General AI computers (The Codex).</p>
	<h4>1. The machines controlled by the Guides are known collectively as the Codex, and have control over day to day operations in the Hab. While being overseen by the Guides, the machines do have great access to many systems and don't need oversight in many areas. They keep the Hab alive by finding the most efficient uses for the available resources, and coordinate all resource gathering outside the Hab, which is also completed by machines.</h4>
	<h4>2. Areas they control:</h4>
	<h5>- Food: resources gathered from the outside are turned into food molecules and synthesised into edible food such as bread and meat for Citizen consumption. The food produced is highly nutritious and is well liked by the Citizens.</h5>
	<h5>- Environment: the machines control the air content, keeping it within homeostasis levels, and temperature at comfortable levels. In the three districts, the machines keep the gardens and forests in constant care, keeping them luscious and growing.</h5>
	<h5>- Security: the Guides have droids placed everywhere within the Hab, and in times when a Citizen commits a crime or a group creates a security rist to others, the machines appeal to a Guide for permission to deploy a squad of security droids to dampen the violence or to arrest an offender. The droids are equipped with extreme strength and versatility in general, and have also been used in emergencies such as a Hab failure.</h5>
	<h5>- Economy: while in Teleios money does not exist and there are no limits to the resources you can use, in Imperium one cannot use more resources than what they're allotted daily. In Proelium, one is paid a certain amount based on their work and on their ability to contribute to the rest of their district. A market keeper in Proelium is allowed a certain amount of variablity in prices so as to allow competition, but only within Codex defined margins.</h5>
	<h5>- Justice: judgements for crimes and decisions for certain events are typically determined by the Codex in Teleios. In Proelium one is convicted by a jury and a tribunal, but with any changes being made by the Codex if necessary. In Imperium, one is reported to an inspector in the Policing Corps, and it is investigated. If the inspector finds enough evidence to prove wrongdoing, the System will take over, and determine punishment.</h5>

	<h2>III. Three societies.</h2>
    <p>A. Teleios (Utopian society)</p>
    <h4>1. All needs and wants are met; disease is non-existent, work is unnecessary, one can play and eat and do whatever they wish for their entire life. All resources necessary for life are brought by machines for the System.</h4>
    <h4>2. Everything is taken care of by computers and machines, so there is no "working class" in the population, all are equal.</h4>
    <h4>3. Anyone can use as much of the resources as they please, there is no money or limits.</h4>
    <h4>4. The only laws that exist are those that keep one from hurting others, whether by attacking physically or mentally.</h4>
    
    <p>B. Imperium (Authoritarian society)</p>
    <h4>1. All needs are taken care of, but only as absolutely as much as that individual needs, and absolutely no liberties such as decoration or other "extravogances".</h4>
    <h4>2. Every day of every citizen is planned to the minute; their work details, feed times, breaks, etc.</h4>
    <h4>3. Breaking the law results in incarceration and harder work for lesser crimes, death for major ones.</h4>
    <h5>- Lesser crimes may include: arguing with peers (*1); not following proper social etiquette codes; not completing a task to satisfaction; being late for a scheduled event, etc.</h5>
    <h5>- Major crimes include: arguing with a citizen of higher rank; theft, fighting, murder, or anything to do with sabotage.</h5>
    
	<p>C. Proelium (Semi-luddite society)</p>
    <h4>1. They do not use electricity for anything, with everything being done manually or with animals. Non-electrical or steam machines are allowed, such as grinding windmills.</h4>
    <h4>2. Their only resources are that which they've gathered with their own hands, with credits being allotted based on System (*2) algorithms for an individiual's work. Prices of resources sold by venders are also controlled by an algorithm, with variability allowed.</h4>
    <h4>3. Laws are stricter than Teleios, but less so than Imperium. Whether someone is punished is determined by a jury rather than the System (*3), but the System can overrule at any point.</h4>

	<h2 class="space">__</h2>
	<h4>Sidenotes.</h4>
	<h5>*1: The mentality of the Imperium district is that the citizens are to follow the schedules and do everything according to what the district decides, and arguing indicates a different mode of thinking from someone else, therefore it is rebellious and must be dealt with.</h5>
	<h5>*2: The System decides the amount of money (credits) an individual makes in Proelium, with maximum and minimum prices of market products controlled by the System. The min-max system allows control of markets and also gives a certain amount of freedom to the consumers/producers of Proelium.</h5>
	<h5>*3: The System controls punishment in Teleios, but in Imperium punishment is determined by a district council. Typically the System will take information on the individual and the crime and determine how harsh the punishment has to be to help 'rehabilitate' the individual based on behavioural analysis algorithms. If the crime is harsh enough, such as murder or rape, death will ensue.</h5>
